# Makefile for CS 2150 post-lab 9
# This Makefile shows how to link assembly with C/C++

main: linkedlist.c
	gcc -std=c99 linkedlist.c
# Defines the C++ compiler we'll be using
#CXX	= clang++ -m32

# Defines the flags we'll be passing to the C++ compiler
#CXXFLAGS	= -Wall -g

# Defines the assembler
#AS	= nasm

# Defines the flags for the assembler
#ASFLAGS	= -f elf

# All of the .o files for our program
#OFILES	= timer.o threexplusone.o threexinput.o

# This tells make to create a .o file from a .cpp file, using the
# defaults above (i.e. the CXX and CXXFLAGS macros)
#.SUFFIXES: .o .cpp

# This tells make to create a .o file from a .s file, using the
# defaults above (i.e. the AS and ASFLAGS macros)
#.SUFFIXES: .o .s

# How to compile our final program.  Note that we do NOT specify an
# output executable name -- in order for this to work with the grading
# system, the file needs to be a.out (a.exe in Cygwin).
#main:	$(OFILES)
#	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(OFILES)

# This will clean up (remove) all our object files.  The -f option
# tells rm to forcily remove the files (i.e. don't ask if they should
# be removed or not).  This removes object files (*.o) and Emacs
# backup files (*~)
clean:
	/bin/rm -f *.o *~

# We don't have any dependencies for this small program
